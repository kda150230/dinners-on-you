   activation range of a mine
 # Bug: After starting the game, pressing the waypoint key without moving
	causes the destroyer to charge to and pass the enemy base; continuing
	forever offscreen. Quite humerous to watch with speed temporarily at 5
 # Bug: In an attempt to curb mine location spamming, a 5 second timer was
	implemented so that after destroying your own mine so that you may
	put it in a new location; there is a waiting period before you may place
	a fresh one. However, this is currently broken, and after one mine
	self-destruct, you are not able to place any more mines.

 # Bug: Blue destroyer might shoot past the waypoint instead of stopping
 # Bug: Red destroyer might vanish when it passes the waypoint instead of stopping
