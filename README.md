This project is over 7 years old, and dates back to when I first started learning to program. The code is messy and unoptimized
at best, and hacky and cryptic at worst, but represents one of my first collaborative efforts to complete a full, playable game.

Two players use the same keyboard (WASD/numpad) to face off over a dinner bill dispute. Players must destroy the opponents base
while defending their own. Command a heavy-hitting Destroyer ship while laying mines to defend your territory. Loser gets stuck
with the bill, so fight with everything you've got!

The game runs in a Java applet, and with proper permissions modifications can still be ran today. My end goal for this project
is for a full rewrite in Java or perhaps a sequel of sorts in Unity. Nevertheless, I expect to commit a new branch with some
basic bugfixes and performance improvements, and maybe even a workaround for the applet issues the project faces today.

Credit to Cameron F. for major contributions to the game's vision and code.
